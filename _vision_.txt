Ideas from over2sd:
	A database with Web/Android forms allowing members to post or fulfill offers/requests for produce, work performed, furniture or other goods, or storage space
	Storage space and produce offers have expiration dates to prevent old produce from remaining "in stock" and to prevent storage from being kept full indefinitely.
	

Ideas from Dandroid87:


Established wishlist:
	Web site for ministry (PHP? Stored on designated server, not Git?)
	Member roster
