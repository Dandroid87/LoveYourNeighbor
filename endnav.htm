		<h1>Lending a helping hand</h1>
		<p>This doesn't look like a finished site, does it?</p><p>It shouldn't, because this page is only a skeleton, and it is intended to show you the basic framework of a site you could have, not to show you how a finished site would actually look. The colors are garish for a reason. They are intended to show you the underlying structure of the page. All the background colors will be changed to colors appropriate to your particular Web project. They could even be made transparent or all the same, so that the structure becomes invisible, letting your content appear to simply flow in its respective boxes as if by its own practical and useful desire.</p><p>Remember, this is only a skeleton. Your finished site will be positioned, polished, and colored according to your unique needs and choices. Use your imagination to see the potential of this design skeleton. We can flesh it out until it looks the way you want it, and then this ugly page will be transformed into your beautiful Web page or site.</p>
		<h1>Design Principles</h1>
		<p>So, what is the big deal about design, in the first place? Why do we need design at all?
We need design in Web sites and all other publications (even in most areas of our lives). Improvisation, such as using any blunt object at hand to try to drive a nail, is not very efficient, and it tends to damage the object used in a purpose for which it was not designed. The fact is that everything has a design, but we often misapply things, leading to mistakes, loss of effort, damage, and shoddy appearances. Now, it is possible to repurpose something by modifying its design or properly applying it in a manner that was not previously considered by man or beast, but everything has a design and an intended purpose. It is that purpose that gives whatever the object is its best, most efficient utility.</p><p>Words, pictures, and hypertext are the same. They have meaning, purpose, and an ideal utility.</p><p>This leads us to one of the design principles I learned during my long and expensive college career. These became mantras for us as budding designers, and they are as valuable for the task of designing a page as the wisdom in the book of Proverbs is for living:</p><p><em>Every Mark Has Meaning</em> - Every word, every image, every rule (line) or border, and every movement has a meaning, so designers must be aware of what that meaning is, because some of the visitors to your Web site will understand the correct meaning of what you've placed there, but if you do not, you may be sending a message you did not intend. That miscommunication may be merely embarassing, or it may be costly or even dangerous. This leads directly into another principle, because it is the reason you need to know and apply this principle:</p><p><em>Communicate, Don't Decorate</em> - Words, images, and other data that communicate add value to your Web site. Elements that do not communicate but merely decorate the screen meaninglessly subtract value because, at best, they waste bandwidth; at worst, they misconsture and alter the meaning of other, more important marks on the screen. Making decisions based on decoration leads to such mistakes as putting a distracting animation next to important text or juxtaposing an image with words in a misleading combination. Making decisions based on what you wish to communicate leads to clarity and elegance. And while we're on that subject:</p><p><em>Words and Pictures Must Work Together in Harmony</em> - This is very important. If there is a disparity in the content or topical tone between the words and the images, viewers may experience dissonance that bothers them, even if they don't recognize why the page is troubling. The words and pictures on a page need to tell the same story. They shouldn't say the same things, except for photo captions, but they should reveal compatible threads of information.</p><p>I'd like to comment on one more thing that is troublingly common in Web sites. It has been since the World Wide Web became a popular place to post information. It takes many forms (each of which you should be able to find just by performing a search query on their names), including the dreaded blink tag, the marquee tag, popups, popunders, autostart music, what Vincent Flanders calls "High on Kai", and trailer text (that follows your cursor). It is usually the result of one of two things: 1) The designer does not respect the visitor and doesn't care what he or she wanted to find on the site, or 2) The designer just learned how to do it and wanted to try it out, or fell in love with it and decided to put it everywhere the designer could get grubby little hands on the code. The remedy is simple. Remember this guiding principle, as useful in business and marriage and financing as it is in Web design, or anywhere else, for that matter:</p><p><em>Can Does Not Equal Should</em> - Just because you're technically able to do something does not mean that prudence or market forces ought to prevent you from doing it.
Yes, you can make text you think is important blink or run across the screen. No, this will not endear you to your visitors or make them more likely to either buy your product/service or finish reading the other information you put on the page with these distracting elements.</p><p>Yes, you can put your favorite song on the page and, wonder of wonders, make it start automagically. No, the visitor who's coming to your site at 3 a.m. because he works nights will not be happy with you after you've awakened his kids with your multimedia presentation that starts at full volume.
Yes, you can make a little welcome message follow the cursor. No, your visitors will not be doing business with you once they notice that a minor programming error on your part prevents them from clicking on any of your links because the trailer text is under the cursor instead of near it.
So, no, you should not let yourself have unbridled freedom to do anything you discover you are able to do. Exercise prudence and decorum. Your site can still be fun without doing things that would make your visitors respond to the question, "Isn't that neat?" with, "No. Just, no." In fact, if you find yourself doing something on your site that brings into being a desire to ask anybody the question, "Isn't that neat/cool/awesome?", it's time to hit the delete key. You're probably rushing in where angels fear to tread. "Isn't that neat?" does not belong on the Web site of a real organization.</p>

		<br />I met a traveler from an antique land Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand, Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown, And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, Tell that its sculptor well those passions read Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed; And on the pedestal these words appear: "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!" Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away. --Percy Bysshe Shelley. <br /><p>I met a traveler from an antique land Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert.
